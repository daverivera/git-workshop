Tree structure
==============

``.git`` content

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 1,3,6-9

  HEAD
  branches/
  config
  description
  hooks/
  index
  info/
  objects/
  refs/

**Basic files**

* ``config`` file contains your project-specific configuration options.
* ``info`` directory keeps a global exclude file for ignored patterns that you donâ€™t want to track in a .gitignore file.

**Important files**

* ``HEAD`` file points to the branch you currently have checked out.
* ``index`` file is where Git stores your staging area information.
* ``objects`` directory stores all the content for your database.
* ``refs`` directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches).
